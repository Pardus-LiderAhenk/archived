## How to Build

> We use Eclipse for Lider and Lider Console related development. See these documentation [here](https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/lider-console/wiki/01.-Setup-Development-Environment) and [here](https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/lider/wiki/01.-Setup-Development-Environment) to setup Eclipse IDE with Lider and Lider Console projects imported.

1. Clone the plugin project by running `git clone https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/lider-ahenk-screenshot-plugin.git`.
2. Open Eclipse and import the plugin project into Eclipse as 'Existing Maven Projects'.
3. Navigate to _lider-ahenk-screenshot-plugin/scripts_ directory and run `build-plugin.sh`.

## How to Run

> Make sure you have Lider, Lider Console and Ahenk running. See these documentation:  [\[1\]](https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/lider/wiki/02.-Building-&-Running), [\[2\]](https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/lider-console/wiki/02.-Building-&-Running) and [\[3\]](https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/ahenk/wiki/02.-Running).

#### Lider

1. Type `feature:repo-add  mvn:tr.org.liderahenk/lider-screenshot-feature/1.0.0/xml/features` on Karaf shell. This will add plugin repository to the Karaf instance.

3. Use `log:tail` and `plugin:list` commands to ensure the plugin is installed and working properly.

1. Open Eclipse, go to 'Run --> Debug Configurations' menu and on 'Plugins' tab, select _lider-console-screenshot_
2. Click 'Add Required Plugins' button to add any plugins the project depend on.
3. Finally you can run Lider Console as explained in its [documentation](https://github.com/Pardus-LiderAhenk/lider-console/wiki/02.-Building-&-Running).
